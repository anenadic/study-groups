## Roles

### Discussion Lead (role rotates weekly)
The Facilitator is responsible for leading the group through a discussion
of the reading material for this session.
They should ensure every group member has an equal opportunity to contribute
to the discussion, and that the discussion is completed in a timely manner.
They also take notes when the Notetaker is speaking.

### Notetaker (role rotates weekly)
Responsible for ensuring that the key points of the discussion are noted. They may do this all themselves or call for help from others e.g. the Group Facilitator. It is important that the Notetaker is also able to contribute to the discussion, so the Discussion Lead should cover notes when the Notetaker is speaking.
The Notetaker also ensures that a copy of the notes is uploaded to the carpentries-incubator/study-groups GitHub repository before the start of the next session.
