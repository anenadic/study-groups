> ## Discussion Prompts
>
> - What feedback do you plan to collect from your learners during the trial run?
>   Is there a particular aspect of your episode that you hope to
>   gather feedback on?
> - How will you and your helper(s) work together during and after the trial run?
> - It is preferable not to teach alone. If you are the sole representative of your
>   lesson in the Study Group, how will your preparations for teaching differ
>   compared to what you do as a member of an instructor team?
> - How long do you expect it will take to teach your trial run of a single episode?
> - What are you looking forward to about the trial run?
> - What do you expect will be challenging?

> ## Homework Tasks
>
> **Note:** there is a break in the program next week, to allow more time
> for these trial runs to be completed.
>
> - If you have not already done so, 
>   complete a review of the episode you were assigned.
> - Coordinate with the helper(s) you recruited for your trial run,
>   to ensure they are prepared to support you in teaching and collecting feedback.
> - In a scheduled "trial run," teach (at least) one episode of your lesson.
> - Open issues on your lesson repository to record the required changes to your lesson that were identified during/after the trial run.
> - Before the Study Group next meets,
>   reflect on the discussion prompts for the next session.
